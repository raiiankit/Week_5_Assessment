Design Notes â€” Copilot-guided refactor

Goal
- Extract duplicated formatting and response-building logic from `moduleA.js` and `moduleB.js` into reusable utilities to improve maintainability, testability, and consistency across modules.

Copilot edit prompts used (design-focused)
- "Extract name formatting and grade calculation into a small `format` utility that handles hyphenated and multi-word names and normalizes case. Keep behavior stable for missing values."
- "Create a `response` utility to centralize id/timestamp generation and standard response shape construction. Ensure modules can still adapt final field names (e.g., `uid`/`createdAt`)."
- "Refactor modules to consume utilities and preserve their external output shapes where possible. Add small adapters if needed."

Coding standards enforced
- Single responsibility: utilities focus on pure transformations and have no side-effects.
- Defensive programming: coerce numeric scores and provide sensible defaults for missing or malformed inputs.
- Minimal API surface for utilities: export only small, well-named functions.
- Preserve module public API: both modules continue to export `processUser` with outward-compatible shapes.

Reusable patterns Copilot suggested
- `formatName(name)`: normalize whitespace/hyphens and return Title Case.
- `scoreToGrade(score)`: canonical grade boundaries using >= comparisons.
- `buildStandardResponse(opts)`: central envelope pattern for id, timestamp and payload.
- `makeId(prefix,max)` & `timestampNow()`: small wrappers for id/timestamp generation to improve swapability and testability.

Notes and next steps
- Unit tests: small unit tests for utilities are included under `test/utils.test.js`. Add integration tests for both modules when behavior must be guaranteed across releases.
- Shared package: extract `src/utils` into a separate package if multiple repositories will depend on the same helpers.
- Types: add TypeScript or richer JSDoc typings to improve editor support and reduce refactor errors.

Design rationale
- Centralizing behavior reduces the chance of drift when rules change (e.g., updating grade logic).
- Small, pure functions make testing straightforward and enhance reusability.

Example usage
- `formatName('bob-smith')` -> 'Bob Smith'
- `scoreToGrade(85)` -> 'B'
- `buildStandardResponse({ payload: { foo: 'bar' } })` -> `{ id: '...', timestamp: '...', foo: 'bar' }`
